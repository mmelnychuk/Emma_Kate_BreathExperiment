/src dir and files backup. see readMe


1. for anyone reinstalling these files:
directory structure will need to be 
preserved. changes may need to be 
made to the .app desktop file if
being clickable is necessary.

2. If the sniffBasic fails:

you need to change some code
if the sniff is replaced, 
in probably a couple programs
as the sniff identifier is 
hard-coded. 
to find the new identifier:

open terminal
type ls /dev/tty*
look for something you think is
possibly correct
change the code to this identifier
try it and see til it works

3. if .app desktop file is corrupted
remake using automator or any other 
method. 

4. This python code is tested for 
Mac OS 10.13.5.
If you want to run on a more recent
os you will have some work to do. 
Check tkinter for sure.
Good Luck.
